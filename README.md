# Pig_Game

## Description

In this pig game, two players are required to play the challenge. Once the first player clicks on the roll dice button it will then generate a random dice roll. This dice roll is then displayed on the screen. If the player rolls a one, then the game automatically resets the current score down to zero and switches to the other player to roll the dice. If the dice roll is not a one, then the dice roll will be added to the current score. Once the player clicks on the hold button, the current score is added to their total score, and then it becomes the next players turn to roll the dice and so on. If a player's score is great than or equal to 100, than the current player wins! You are also able to reset this game by clicking on the new game button.
